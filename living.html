<strong>Living Room</strong> <br> Aside from watching tv this is wehere I usually sleep during Prelims, Midterm and Finals because whenever I am in my room I always fell asleep and in the end I am not able to finish the things I need to do so to avoid that I sleep in the couch.This is also where I am playing with my Baby petty her name is Marble (She doesn't want to move while I am taking the photo so I let her to be in the picture, just a little exposure)<br><br><em>(NOTICE: click on the upper right) </em>
