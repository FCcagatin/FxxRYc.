<strong>My Room</strong> <br>Bed, Fan, picture frames, tables and books that is all I have in my room but still this room is the most precious place I would ever have. This witnessed my up's and down's in life, the way I cry at my problems and laugh at myself after sometime. This is my personal space so the me inside this room is my side that nobody knows other than me and only me. <br><br><em> END OF TOUR</em><br><br><br><strong>THANK YOU!!!</strong>
