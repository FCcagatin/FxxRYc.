<strong>Dining Room</strong> Breakfast, Luch and dinner is all I am doing in thedining area and since we do not have a family area in our house this also where we are having a family meeting. I don't know why we are not doing it in the Dining area while our Living room is free and available.<br><br><em>(NOTICE: click at the stairs) </em>
