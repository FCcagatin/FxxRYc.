	<br>A family is like a circle
	<br>the connection never ends
	<br>and even if at times it breaks
	<br>in time it always mends
	<br>a family is like the stars
	<br>somehow they're always there
	<br>families are those who help
	<br>who support and always care
	<br>A family is like a book
	<br>the endings never clear
	<br>but through the pages of the book
	<br>their love is always near
	<br>A family is many things
	<br>with endless words that show
	<br>who they are and what they do
	<br>and how they teach you so you know
	<br>but don't be weary if it's broken
	<br>or if through time its been so worn
	<br>families are like that-
	<br>they're split up and always torn
	<br>but even if this happens
	<br>your family will always be
	<br>they help define just who you are
	<br>and will be apart of you eternally<br><br><br></td>

A lot of people are<br/> saying that when you put makeup you look like a flirt specially the oldies. Well, <br/>for us millenials we do not just put makeup or cosmetics for occasions it is already <br/>considered a our daily routine. AT school, work, mall or even in groceries it <br/>is a necessity. There are times that I am judged by the others but I don't mind<br/> because I know that this is my booster and I will not let go of one thing I treasure<br/> so bad just because I am judged.</em>

Cooking is is my passion whenever Im in the kitchen <br/>I feel like I am in my own skin like i do not have to pretend like I love what I am doing, cause I really do. <br/><br/>I am now in my 3rd year college and I am taking Bachelor of Science major in PSYCHOLOGY.<br/> Yes, psychology and I don't really know why I am in this field. But no one forced me to be here<br/> or whatever it is my own choice of path. I decided to put cooking aside and just be my comfort zone <br/>and not my profession. I have my own reason for that though but still I know deep inside me that someday i will pursue this passion of mine.</em>

Specially reading, mayb not a lot of people<br/> find it boring but my family does. My Family are extraverts , beaches and parties are their thing.<br/><br/> I do also love party thought, who doesn't it is just that I don't like being around a lot of people I do not know. <br/>Crazy right, except for concerts though, I do not know why but whenever I'm with my co-beliebers even though <br/>I do not know them personally I can feel a bond between them. <br/>Maybe because we have our same perspectives for we are into same iterest. <br/><br/>I am not purely Introvert though, according to Carl jung every individual is a mixture of Introvert and extravert. <br/>I still enjoy the company of others and things like socialization still exist in my vocabulary.</em></p><br/><br/>
